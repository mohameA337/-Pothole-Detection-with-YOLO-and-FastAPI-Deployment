The dataset includes 3771 images.
UAV-detection are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 512x512 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -13 and +13 degrees
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1.1 pixels
